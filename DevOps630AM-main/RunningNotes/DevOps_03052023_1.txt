chown : Change ownership of a file.

*) if we use ls -l we get details of file that contains user(owner) and group names.
*) We can modify those details using chown

ex:
sudo chown sam:devops message.txt
sudo chown sam message.txt
sudo chown :devops message.txt

*)Note: above command will update only for one file/directory at a time.
=> If we want to update owner and group details for both directory and
 its files including sub-directories then use flag '-R' 


Q) What is the difference between 'chmod' and 'chown' commands?
chmod ---> it is used for managing file permissions (r,w,x)
chown ---> it is used for managing file ownership ( user:group )

===================================================================
*) Note:
=> If a file name starts with dot(.) ex: .formats then it is called as hidden file
=> to see all hidden files use " ls -a " (or) " ls -la "

$ sudo yum install htop -y
$ htop
