-------------------
*)User/Group Commands and File Permissions

1. Linux is Multi-user OS and supports groups.
2. We create multiple users and add/remove to different groups.
3. Group is a logical unit of users (based on roles)
Ex:
  Developers, Admins, Testing, Support, ..etc

--case study--------
1. we create new user 
$ sudo useradd ajay

2. we add password to user

$ sudo passwd ajay
Enter Password : ****
Re-Enter Password: ****

$ id ajay

3. we create new group

$ sudo groupadd devops

4***. we add user to group
$ sudo usermod -aG devops  ajay 

5***. we remove user from group
# Detach user from group (still both user and group exist)
$ sudo gpasswd -d ajay devops

6. we remove user/group from OS.
$ sudo userdel ajay
$ sudo groupdel devops

-------------------------

*) Note: For every user one directory is created by LinuxOS
 ie called as User Home.
 ex:
   Username          User-Home Directory
 --------------------------------------------
     ajay              /home/ajay/
     syed              /home/syed/
     ec2-user          /home/ec2-user/

*)Note:
When we create a new user (ex: ajay) also a new group is created 
with same user name (ex: ajay)


Q) Where all users/groups data is stored?
/etc/passwd  and /etc/group

Q) What is the default group is created when a new user is created?
When we create a new user (ex: ajay) also a new group is created 
with same user name (ex: ajay)

Q) How can we find who are all users added to a given group?
sudo lid -g <groupname>

==Task===================================
1. create 3 users ajay, sam, syed
2. create a group devops and developers
3. add ajay,sam to devops also sam,syed to developers.
4. Detach all users from their groups added
5. remove all groups and users.
=========================================

r -> read
w -> write/modify/remove
x -> execute -> run and see output (shell commands/ shell script)


*) Example:
1) write file permissions order (it is file)
user can read(r) and execute(x)
group can read
other can execute 

A) -r-xr----x

2) write file permissions order (it is file)
user can read(r), write(w) and execute(x)
group can read(r) and write(w)
other can read(r) 

-rwxrw-r--

3) write file permissions order (it is file)
user can read(r) and write(w) 
group can read(r) and execute(x)
other can execute(x) only

-rw-r-x--x

====================================================
File permissions using chmod :
+ -> will add given permission 
- -> will remove given permission
= -> will reset with given permission

Q) Modify file(test.txt) pemissions in given format
 user can read(r=4) and write(w=2)
 group can read(r=4) and execute(x=1)
 others can execute(x=1)

 chmod u=rw test.txt
 chmod g=rx test.txt
 chmod o=x test.txt

 chmod 651 test.txt

Q) Modify file(model.txt) pemissions in given format
 user can read, write and execute
 group can execute
 others can read and write

 chmod 716 model.txt
