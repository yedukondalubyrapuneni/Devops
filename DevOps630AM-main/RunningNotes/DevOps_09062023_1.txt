---------------------
Dockerfile : Contains instructions to create an Image
FROM
EXPOSE
CMD
RUN
ENTRYPOINT

DockerImage : Packaged Software (Code + Dependencies)
DockerHub(Register) : A Place to store Docker Images
DockerContainer : Running/Execution form of Image
DockertNetwork  : Connection between container.
DockerVolumes   : Persisted Storage to share data between containers.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Docker Compose: 
-> It is a YAML file
-> To create and connect multiple containers.
-> It avoids executing multiple docker commands.
-> You can even define order of creating containers.
-> We can provide network creation,connections.
-> We can even specify volums to be created and connected.

-> using 'docker-compose up' docker creates all above setup.
   using 'docker-compose down' docker remvoes all above setup (not volumes)

file name: docker-compose.yml.
