---------------------------

Application Development Designs:-
1. Monolithic 
Everything in one application

2. Microservices
=> Every small service is one application.
=> So, there will be multiple docker containers are created.
  Bcoz of so many users/customers..etc

=> Better always create multiple container in multiple machines
  (for backup) High Availability.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
SWARM = Group of Docker Machines or a Docker cluster.

orchestration = manage a cluster => create, scale up/down, upgrade(latest versions),
		rollback (come back to old versions), destroy, loadbalance.


If you do not want to add sudo everytime for docker commands
then execute below
$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
$ exit
Then press R
