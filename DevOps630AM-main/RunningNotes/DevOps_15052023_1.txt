--------------------
*) CodeQuality / Standard Code:
=> It can be validated manually by Senior Developers in Team
=> We can even use a tool that validates our code
  [static code analyzer] - SonarQube.

Q) How Quality standards are decided?
A) Inside Sonarqube, Developer creates rules to validate code.

Q) What is Code Coverage / Test Coverage?
A) In Developer code certain benchmark (ex: 80%) must be tested
   by developer using Test Framework (JUnit + Mockito..etc)


Q) What sonarqube will do?
1) Duplicate Code: Check full code and provide duplicates to developer to modify
2) Coding Standards: Applies All rules set and provides a detailed report
3) Unit Tests: Executes JUnit Test cases written by developers.
4) Code Coverage: Display how much percent of code is tested.
4) Complex Code: Reads existed code, shows better way of writing it.
5) Commented Code: Validates comments written in code
6) Potential Bugs: Checks how many bugs exist in application.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Developer Work: Use sonarQube and modify code as per instructions,
	Modify Rules, Add/Remote/check rules, reports..

DevOps Engineer: Install / Configure SonarQube, Link with Projects, Link with Jenkins.
