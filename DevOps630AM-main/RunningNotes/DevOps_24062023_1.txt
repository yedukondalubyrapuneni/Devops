--------------------
*) Issue: (Bug found in minikube)
We get a default storage class, delete that 
$ kubectl delete sc standard

# Connect into pod/container
$ kubectl exec -it mysql-deployment-64b447589-r9gcq -- bash

# login into MySQL
$ mysql -h mysql-service -u root -p
Enter password:

mysql> create database sbms;
mysql> use sbms;
mysql> show tables;
mysql> create table users(uid int, uname varchar(10));
mysql> insert into users values(10,'A');
mysql> insert into users values(11,'B');
mysql> select * from users;

# delete current pod
-----------------------------
Any issues while re-creating deployments, do this:
(like Error, Pending, crashloopbackoff)

minikube stop
minikube delete
docker system prune --all
sudo sync && echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
docker volume ls
(if exist any delete) -> docker volume rm <volume-name>
minikube start
-----------------------------
Stateless : If pod is re-created, then data exist inside the pod is lost
Stateful : If pod is re-created, old pod data still exist in new pod also.

state = data (Database, filesystem ..etc)

Q) how can we manage?
A) Store data outside of Pod and link with it.
   using Volumes.

-> Deployment + PVC + PV 3 need to be created by Dev.
-> StatefulSet : it creates pod, pv+pvc templates.

*) (AWS)EBS, EFS, S3, RDS are mostly used compared to stateful.
*) k8s is mostly used for pure deployments (stateless)

Note:
1. StatefulSet never creates any ReplicaSet internally.
2. STS provides sticky identity (pod-0,pod-1,pod-2 ..etc)
3. STS index-0 pod is only allowed to read/write, other pods only allowed for read.
4. If we create new pod, copy from previous pod.
5. We we scale down, then always delete last pod.
6. STS creates POd with PVC, but not pv.
