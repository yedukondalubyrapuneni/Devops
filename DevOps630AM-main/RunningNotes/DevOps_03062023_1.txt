--------------------

Java, Git, Jenkins ...etc
Tomcat, MySQL, Run Our App (.war/.jar/.py/.dll..etc)


Docker Image = Application [Code] (.war) + Dependencies (JRE/Tomcat/MySQL ..etc)

VIRTUALIZATION: Share Hardware to install Multiple-OS, then install s/w and run apps.

CONTAINERIZATION: Install s/w, run app --> independent of OS

Docker: is a CONTAINERIZATION platform.

Dockerfile: Set of Instructions (apps details, Dependencies details) to create Image.

Docker Image: Docker understandable software (Dockerfile->build-> Image)

Docker Container: 
     Run Image (one time/multiple times)-->Running Instance is called Container


Create one Account Here:
https://hub.docker.com/

docker images -> to view all images
docker ps     -> to view running containers
docker ps -a  -> to view all(running/stopped) containers
docker pull   -> To fetch/pull image from Register
docker run    -> To create a container from image

docker system prune -a => To reset docker deamon (Clear all objects)

Note: If we try to run an image which is not present in our local machine
  (Docker Deamon) then docker run command will "pull first and run next"

docker rm  -> to delete container
ex: docker rm <container-id>
docker rmi -> to delete image
ex: docker rmi hello-world

docker stop <container-id>
docker start <container-id>
