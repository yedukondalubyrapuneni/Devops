Tags - used for grouping tasks,
       this is used to provide labels
       this is for selecting tasks/skipping tasks for execution.

## Execute all tasks
$ ansible-playbook apps-test.yml 

## Execute tasks only having copy tag
$ ansible-playbook apps-test.yml --tags "copy" 

## Execute tasks only having install,copy tags
$ ansible-playbook apps-test.yml --tags "install,copy" 

## Skip tasks having install tag
$ ansible-playbook apps-test.yml --skip-tags "install" 

1. I have a plybook to install httpd and copy file.
   That contains handlers for start on install changed and restart on copy changed.
   2nd time onwards we need to execute a playbook only copy task.
   Do not execute install task.
   For this what is the command?

$ ansible-playbook HandlersTest.yml --tags "copy"
$ ansible-playbook HandlersTest.yml --skip-tags "install"
