Linux

*) Linux Kernel is like OS that conncts with H/w components.
*) Open Source : You take code, check, modify, upgrade, release..
*) Shell : Software(Code), interpreter
   User -> type commands (ex: mkdir ) -> Terminal -> Shell -> Convert into Kernel format
*) Applications: set of commands/statements to do some work.


EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud 
*) These are Region based Services.
*) Ex: If we create Ec2 Instance in ap-south-1 (mumbai)
   then it can not be accessed from other region.

*) Private key is generated and shared by AWS to Users to secure connection.
*) File extension is .pem - Privacy Enhanced Mail.

*) Linux Machines by default uses 8GB SSD (Volume).

*) We need one SSH (Secure Shell) Client s/w to connect with EC2 Instance
Ex: MobaXTerm, OpenSSH.


============Stage#1 Launch AWS Linux Machine =======================
1. Goto : https://aws.amazon.com/console/ , click on login
2. Choose Region based on your location
  India : ap-south-1
3. Click on Launch Instance and choose same
(check all details in document)

===========Stage#2 Connect to Machine using your PC=================
4. Choose any client software to connect like MobaXTerm
5. Fill details
  Public IP
  Username : ec2-user
  Port : 22
  and Security KeyPair (.pem) file

===========Stage#3 Execute some commands  =================
6. Now we can type Linux commands like
ls
pwd
who
date
uptime
logout (to come out)
Press 'R' to reconnect

===========Stage#4 disconnect to Machine and Terminate Instance in AWS=============
7. Goto AWS account and click on Instance check box and choose instance state 
   terminate to stop instance.

Linux:
/   --> root folder/directory
~   --> home directory of current user

# -> Root User
$ -> Normal User

Windows:
D:/Test/sample/abc.txt

Linux:
/Text/sample/abc.txt

Basic Linux Commands:
1. ls -> to view files and folder 
2. touch -> to create an empty file / update timestamp of a file
3. echo "Message" -> To print message to console
4. rm <filename> -> to delete a file
5. > (use symbol) -> To write/redirect output to a file
6. cat <filename> : To display content of a file


FAQs:
Q) What is the diff b/w Stop and Terminate EC2 Instance?
Q) Does Public IP gets changed by AWS EC2 if we restart?
Q) What are all details required for SSH Connection ?

Q) Explain Linux Machine File System ?
